# Breakfast Menu 


#  INTRODUCTION
   This is a Menu Page for a Restaurant  I created
   It has Navigational links to navigate <br>from the main 
   page to look at the menu items and back to the main page .<br>
   It also has a order# input box so that customers can place their orders
   with their name and order numbers included. <br>I learned a lot about image links in html
   as well as adding nav links and using different css properties and classes
   to style pages.
